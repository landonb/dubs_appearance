  " Tone down the tildes
  " ------------------------------------------------------
  " Vim displays tildes (~) to represent lines that
  " appear in a window but are not actually part of
  " the buffer (i.e., for visual lines that follow
  " the last line of a buffer). This isn't too
  " distracting unless you verially split a window,
  " then the empty buffer on the right is full of
  " colorful blue tildes. You could tone this done
  " by, say, changing the tildes to pink, i.e.,
  "
  "   highlight NonText guifg=Pink2
  "
  " but, really, since Vim is displaying line
  " numbers -- and since line numbers are only
  " displayed for actual lines in the document --
  " we don't even need the tildes! You can simply
  " infur the end of the document by where the line
  " numbers are no longer displayed. (Note that
  " guifg=NONE seems like the proper way to do
  " this, but it makes the tildes black, not
  " transparent (or maybe I missed something when I
  " tried it).)
  " FIXME: 2012.09.21: This isn't working from here: you can manually
  " :set list and then :highlight... and the whitespace chars are shown
  " in the same gray as the line numbers, but if you just :set list, the
  " whitespace chars don't appear, even with the same highlight here....

  " Mock zellner
  " ------------------------------------------------------
  " The zellner color scheme changes the status
  " line for the active window. The default is that
  " each status line (i.e., the line beneath each
  " window) is white text on a black background,
  " save for the active window (the window where
  " the cursor is), which is yellow text on a dark
  " gray background. (For the default color scheme,
  " the active window's status line is bold white
  " on black, and inactive windows' status lines
  " are normal white on black.)
  "
  " This is what's set in zellner.vim:
  "
  "    highlight StatusLine
  "    \ term=bold,reverse cterm=NONE |
  "    \ ctermfg=Yellow ctermbg=DarkGray |
  "    \ gui=NONE guifg=Yellow guibg=DarkGray
  "
  " Note that zellner does not specify StatusLineNC
  " (for inactive windows), so it remains the
  " default -- white foreground and black
  " background. This is annoying; I don't like some
  " status lines being black and one being dark
  " gray, so let's make them all dark gray. This
  " means using the same settings zellner uses for
  " StatusLine, but also adding StatusLineNC,
  " specifying that inactive windows' status lines
  " use the same background as the active window
  " status line but instead use a white foreground
  " (font) color.

  highlight StatusLine term=bold,reverse gui=NONE
    \ guifg=Yellow guibg=DarkGray
    \ cterm=NONE ctermfg=Yellow ctermbg=DarkGray

  highlight StatusLineNC term=reverse gui=NONE
    \ guifg=White guibg=DarkGray
    \ ctermfg=White ctermbg=DarkGray

  " Between two windows that are vertically split, there are
  " black rectangles with white bars inside. Make the vertical
  " tab characters to be white on white, hiding them.

  " Highlight columns color.
  " I use this to help me manually wrap long lines (when not using parT).
  " 2014.11.18: [lb] happened to load the "Highlight long lines" page
  "   on Wikia <http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Highlight_long_lines> and
  "   thankfully I found out Vim 7.3 includes a newer, better way to
  "   highlight line length!
  " See also in the syle plugin
  "   https://github.com/landonb/dubs_style_guard
  " e.g., `set colorcolumn=77,78,79`.
  " The default color is a lightish pink, which is kinda atrocious.

  " For color reference see :h cterm-colors
  " Here's the list of light colors:
  "  LightRed LightGreen LightCyan LightMagenta LightYellow LightGray
  " [lb] tried Red and LightRed but red is too loud and obnoxious.
  " So then I just tried LightBlue and it seems to fit in nicely.

1. About This Plugin			*dubs-appearance-about*

This plugin configures the appearance of Vim.

- The beautiful Hack Regular 9 font, falling back to Courier New 9.
  https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack

- A 3-Column wide grey vertical long-line indicator over columns 78-80.

  - See dubs_edit_juice's <F2> mappings for paragraph formatting.

- Use <Ctrl-c> to exit Insert mode, and to enter Command mode, same as <ESC>.

- Use <Ctrl-c> to copy text in the command-line window.

- Enable syntax highlighting.

- Show line numbers.

- Show new buffers with all folds open.

  (Hint: Use `<zR>` and `<zM>` to open and close all folds,
  respectively, and `<zA>` to toggle a single fold).

- Better search defaults:

  - Case-insensitive searching and matching (`:smartcase`).

  - Enable search term highlighting (`:hlsearch`).

  - Highlight search results as the keyword is typed (`:incsearch`).

- Enable `modeline`: Vim will read modelines at the head or tail,
  like `vim:tw=78:ts=8:ft=help:norl:`, and set itself accordingly.

- Enable `:autoindent` and `:smartindent`.

  - And enable loading `indent/` files.

- Enable `:wildmenu`, a/k/a, Vim command line tab completion.

- Show the status line and rule.

- Break longs lines on word boundaries.

- Make a close a close. The default Gvim menu behavior for File < Close
  (`<Alt-f>` `<c>`) just hides the buffer. Close the file in addition.

- Rewire File > Close (`<Alt-f>` `<c>`) so that it closes the buffer, too.

- Rewire File > Save All (`<Alt-f>` `<l>`) to save all files.

  - To allow us, File > Split-Open is remapped (to `<Alt-f>` `<t>`).

- Use Window > New V-Split (`<Alt-w>` `<s>`) to open a new buffer
  in a new window to the right of the current window.

- Add File > Close All (`<Alt-f>` `<e>`) to close all files / delete
  all buffers.

 - If you Close All and then Exit (`<Alt-f>` `<x>`), because there's
   only one, empty buffer, Vim will delete `Session.vim`. This is useful
   if you've edited a `~/.vim/*` script and want to reload it; otherwise,
   if a Session file exists, Vim will just read it and ignore other stuff.

- Save the current Session on exit; restore it on open.

  To clear the session -- e.g., after editing any Vim file -- type

    `<Alt-f>` `<e>`, and then
    `<Alt-f>` `<x>`.

  - The first command
      closes all files,
      deletes all buffers, and
      removes the Session file.

  - The second command quits Vim.

  When you restart Vim, it'll start with a fresh
  Session file and load any Vim edits you made.

- Set the `*.swp` file `:directory` to `$HOME/.vim_backups/`

- Disable backups (set `:nobackup`).

  You should use `<Ctrl-s>` or `<Alt-f>` `<Alt-l>` frequently.

  And commit to Git often. Do other things often.

- Disable the frakking bell.

The plugin also improves upon the default color scheme.

- White background with black text, and non-distracting grey line numbers.

- Slash `/` and Star `*` Searches are highlighted with a green background.

- Change line numbers color from deep red (default) to dark grey.

- Remove distracting vertical split line between adjacent windows.

- Or, if you have Dubs After Dark installed, this plugin will load
  the `after-dark` color scheme.

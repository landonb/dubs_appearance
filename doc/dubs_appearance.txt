1. About This Plugin			*dubs-appearance-about*

Basic Vim configuration (no functions; just settings and mappings).

This plugin configures some basic Vim settings and mappings to
the liking of the Dubsacks developer. There are no functions
or features defined in this plugin, rather, it just configures
a number of basic appearance- and mapping-related Vim features.

For instance, I like a white background; Courier New 9 font;
Ctrl-C to work in Command mode; using a green color to highlight
search matches; always showing the status line; etc.

This plugin also enables so-called MS-DOS mode and configures
some menu item shortcuts.

Please see the source for all the settings and more comments.

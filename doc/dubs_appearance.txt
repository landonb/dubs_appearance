1. About This Plugin			*dubs-appearance-about*

This plugin configures the appearance of Vim:

- White background with black text, and non-distracting grey line numbers.

- Hack Regular 9 font, falling back to Courier New 9.
  https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack

- A 3-Column wide grey vertical long-line indicator over columns 78-80.

  - See dubs_edit_juice's <F2> mappings for paragraph formatting.

- <Ctrl-c> to exit Insert mode, and to enter Command mode, same as <ESC>.

- Slash </> and Star <*> Searches are highlighted with a green background.

- Always show the status line (line number, column number, etc.).

- Always show the status line, and column and line numbers.

- Enable so-called MS-DOS mode and configures menu item shortcuts.

  - In addition to <Ctrl-c> working in Normal and Insert modes,
    also make <Ctrl-c> work in the command-line window.

- Save the current Session on exit; restore it on open.

  To clear the session -- e.g., after editing any Vim file -- type
  <Alt-f> <e>, and then <Alt-f> <x>. The first command closes all
  files, deletes all your buffers, and removes the Session file.
  The second command quits Vim. When you restart Vim, it'll start
  with a fresh Session file and load any Vim edits you made.

- Set the *.swp file `directory` to $HOME/.vim_backups/

- Set the `backupdir` to $HOME/.vim_backups/
  but set `nobackup` also! Because you should
  <Ctrl-s> save or <Alt-f> <Alt-l> save all
  frequently.

- Enable syntax highlighting.

- Change line numbers color from deep red (default) to dark grey.

- Show new buffers with all folds open. No folding! Unless you <zM> or <zA>.

- Case-insensitive, `smartcase` searching and matching,
  enable search term highlighting (`hlsearch`),
  highlight search results as the keyword is typed (`incsearch`).

- Enable modeline. Vim will read modelines at the head or tail,
  like `vim:tw=78:ts=8:ft=help:norl:`, and set itself accordingly.

- Enable `autoindent` and `smartindent`.

- Disable the frakking bell.

- Don't show a vertical column of ~ tildes ~ for lines after EOF.

- Remove distracting visualization when splitting windows.

- Enable auto-indent of selected code.

- Make close a close. Default Gvim <Alt-f> <c> behaviour just hides
  the buffer. Actually close the file instead.

- Try <Ctrl-w> <p> to split the current buffer in a window above.

See the source for a few other settings and more comments.

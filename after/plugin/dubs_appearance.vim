" 2017-04-03: In Insert mode, at work, Ctrl-X is now inserting "+x -- what the hell.
"  I didn't change anything, I swear!
" 2017-04-03: Argh, I did compile Vim 8.0, but only at home!
"  Speaking with a co-worker last week about Vim, I remember seeing 7.x running at work.
"  Oops! I forgot to update also at work... (I added a custom build to
"    github.com/landonb/home-fries/blob/master/.fries/once/custom_setup.extras.sh
"  at 2017-02-27 10:17:12). Anyway, now I'm have a counter-problem at home!
"  The new mvwin.vim,
"    /srv/opt/bin/share/vim/vim80/mswin.vim
"  sets <c-f> and <c-h> (to find, and find-replace, respectively)
"  which overrides dubsacks' <c-h> (clear highlight!).
" So disabling this now that I'm back home...
" MONITOR/WATCH/2017-04-03: mswin.vim needs to load before
"   dubs_edit_juice/plugin/dubs_edit_juice.vim (which set <c-h>)
"   Dubs does not set <c-f>, so the mswin 'VIM - Search...' dialog pops up.

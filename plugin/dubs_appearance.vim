" NOTE Vim's default is to set

"      which means we can't update _this_ file
"      without first deleting ~/.vim/Session.vim
"      or ~/vimfiles/Session.vim -- otherwise,
"      Session.vim overrides any changes we make
"      here (because it stores mappings, etc.,
"      and is loaded after this file).
"      Alternatively, we could set
"      sessionoptions to save only winsize,
"      buffers, etc., but not options: though I
"      haven't tested this, so for now: delete
"      Session.vim if you m*ck w//touch this
"      fi#e.
"
" NOTE I still haven't figured out unloaded/
"      hidden buffers, such that :Bclose all and
"      restarting Vim starts with the buffers
"      you just closed -- as a kludge, we'll

"  EditPlus-inspired File Command Mappings
" ------------------------------------------------------

" 'It doesn't suck,' says BBEdit. Which I
" started using sometime in the 90s. Then
" I graduated college, and some corporation
" sent monies my way to program on Windows.
" So I found EditPlus, which is the most
" baddest-ass Windows GUI editor ever. No
" Intellisence for me, thank you very much!
" Just file and project browsing, and regex
" searching to boot. And lots of nice keyboard
" shortcuts. Some of which we mock herein. Who
" doesn't have <M-f>e seared into their brain?

" Change gVim application menu key mappings
" -----------------------------------------

" Ctrl-W and Ctrl-Q are GUI editor favorites.
" But in gVim on Windows, <C-q> remaps what
" <C-v> was (which is "start Visual mode
" blockwise", so that <C-v> can be used for
" paste), and <C-w> is the start of all Window
" commands (and if you touch that, an angry
" mob of puritan Vimmers will come find you).
" So instead, get used to Alt-F commands, i.e.,
" the File menu.

" The menu is created and populated
"   $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
if has("menu") && has("gui_running")
  " --------------------------------
  " A Close is a close is a close
  " --------------------------------
  " ... No, I mean *REALLY* close it. Don't just
  " hide the dang buffer -- pop it from the list.
  " And show the last buffer we were on.
  "
  " menu.vim's File.Close calls :close, which
  " closes the current window (or hides the
  " active buffer if there's only one window left
  " (and by hide I mean :enew is called to start
  " a new buffer)). So it's not actually closing
  " the file, it's closing the window or making a
  " new buffer. I'm not sure why this is mapped
  " to the File menu... so let's change it and
  " make File.Close really close (i.e., release)
  " the current file buffer. Do any or you Vimmer
  " traditionalists have a problem with that? =)
  " (Also -- redundantly -- the :close command
  "  is mapped to Window.Close, aka <Alt-W>c,
  "  or <Ctrl-W>c.)
  " NOTE 10.330 is File.Close, and 10.335 is
  "      File.-SEP1-
  "      i.e., from menu.vim:
  "   an <silent> 10.330 &File.&Close<Tab>:close
  "     \ :if winheight(2) < 0 <Bar>
  "     \   confirm enew <Bar>
  "     \ else <Bar>
  "     \   confirm close <Bar>
  "     \ endif<CR>
  " 'Un'-menu the existing menu item
  aunmenu File.Close
  " Use :an rather than :menu to apply to all modes.
  an 10.330 &File.&Close<Tab>:Bclose :Bclose<CR>
  " Thanks for :Bclose, Joe! (See: newbufdel.vim)

  " Clear the buffer list

  " <Alt-f>e ==> Close all files. This isn't

  " This command literally deletes all your

  " TODO This is broken if you <Alt-f>c some

  "      one buffer, then modify another buffer,
  "      save it, and quit- on restart, the
  "      buffer I closed is reopened (meaning,
  "      Session.vim was rewrit but still
  "      contains the closed buffers). This also
  "      has to do w/ Vim hidden buffers, which I

  "      have to <Alt-f>x to quit -- I've got it
  "      so if there's only the one empty buffer

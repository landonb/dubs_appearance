" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
" Color Scheme
" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

" I like the White background that the default
" color scheme uses, but the color scheme still
" needs a little tweaking.

" Tone down the tildes
" ------------------------------------------------------
" Vim displays tildes (~) to represent lines that
" appear in a window but are not actually part of
" the buffer (i.e., for visual lines that follow
" the last line of a buffer). This isn't too
" distracting unless you verially split a window,
" then the empty buffer on the right is full of
" colorful blue tildes. You could tone this done
" by, say, changing the tildes to pink, i.e.,
"
"   highlight NonText guifg=Pink2
"
" but, really, since Vim is displaying line
" numbers -- and since line numbers are only
" displayed for actual lines in the document --
" we don't even need the tildes! You can simply
" infur the end of the document by where the line
" numbers are no longer displayed. (Note that
" guifg=NONE seems like the proper way to do
" this, but it makes the tildes black, not
" transparent (or maybe I missed something when I
" tried it).)
highlight NonText guifg=White

" Mock zellner
" ------------------------------------------------------
" The zellner color scheme changes the status
" line for the active window. The default is that
" each status line (i.e., the line beneath each
" window) is white text on a black background,
" save for the active window (the window where
" the cursor is), which is yellow text on a dark
" gray background. (For the default color scheme,
" the active window's status line is bold white
" on black, and inactive windows' status lines
" are normal white on black.)
"
" This is what's set in zellner.vim:
"
"    highlight StatusLine
"    \ term=bold,reverse cterm=NONE |
"    \ ctermfg=Yellow ctermbg=DarkGray |
"    \ gui=NONE guifg=Yellow guibg=DarkGray
"
" Note that zellner does not specify StatusLineNC
" (for inactive windows), so it remains the
" default -- white foreground and black
" background. This is annoying; I don't like some
" status lines being black and one being dark
" gray, so let's make them all dark gray. This
" means using the same settings zellner uses for
" StatusLine, but also adding StatusLineNC,
" specifying that inactive windows' status lines
" use the same background as the active window
" status line but instead use a white foreground
" (font) color.
highlight StatusLineNC term=reverse gui=NONE
  \ guifg=White guibg=DarkGray
  \ ctermfg=White ctermbg=DarkGray
highlight StatusLine term=bold,reverse gui=NONE
  \ guifg=Yellow guibg=DarkGray
  \ cterm=NONE ctermfg=Yellow ctermbg=DarkGray

" Visually Appealing Vertical Split
" ------------------------------------------------------
" When you split a window vertically, there's a
" column of black rectangles that runs between
" the two windows, and each black rectangle has
" a vertical bar in it. This, to me, is very
" distracting!
"
" And you really don't need these rectangles- the
" line numbers in each window provide adequate
" visual separation.
"
" So I like to hide the rectangles.
"
" This is also helpful if you like working with
" narrow text columns but enjoy having whitespace
" on the right side of the editor.
"
" Bare with me while I describe this: I like
" working with two vertical windows, each 50
" characters wide, with my working buffer in the
" left window and an empty buffer in the right.
" Since the buffer in the right window is empty,
" only line number 1 is displayed, and so you end
" up with an awesome chunk of whitespace. Why not
" just work in one window that's 50 characters
" wide? Well, 'cause then your buffer is squished
" in a narrow gVim window and your desktop picture
" is distractingly close to what you're working on.
" Weird, right? Something about how my brain is
" wired...
"
" So here's what we'll do: we'll set linebreak,
" which complements wrap by wrapping lines only
" where visually pleasing, i.e., at the nearest
" whitespace character or punctuation.
" Specifically, :set breakat? returns
"
"    breakat= ^I!@*-+;:,./?
"
" We'll also modify the black rectangles with the
" white vertical tab characters to be white on
" white, which effectively hides them.
set linebreak
highlight VertSplit term=reverse gui=NONE
  \ guifg=White guibg=White
  \ ctermfg=White ctermbg=White

" NOTE When working with two vertically split
"      windows, the left one container your
"      document and the right one containing an
"      empty buffer, the scroll bar for your
"      document is on the left side of the gVim
"      window, rather than on the right. You'll
"      probably eventually get used to this....

  " A Close is a close is a close

  " ... No, I mean *REALLY* close it. Don't just
  " hide the dang buffer -- pop it from the list.
  " And show the last buffer we were on.
  "
  " menu.vim's File.Close calls :close, which
  " closes the current window (or hides the
  " active buffer if there's only one window left
  " (and by hide I mean :enew is called to start
  " a new buffer)). So it's not actually closing
  " the file, it's closing the window or making a
  " new buffer. I'm not sure why this is mapped
  " to the File menu... so let's change it and
  " make File.Close really close (i.e., release)
  " the current file buffer. Do any or you Vimmer
  " traditionalists have a problem with that? =)
  " (Also -- redundantly -- the :close command
  "  is mapped to Window.Close, aka <Alt-W>c,
  "  or <Ctrl-W>c.)
  " NOTE 10.330 is File.Close, and 10.335 is
  "      File.-SEP1-
  "      i.e., from menu.vim:
  "   an <silent> 10.330 &File.&Close<Tab>:close
  "     \ :if winheight(2) < 0 <Bar>
  "     \   confirm enew <Bar>
  "     \ else <Bar>
  "     \   confirm close <Bar>
  "     \ endif<CR>
  " 'Un'-menu the existing menu item
  aunmenu File.Close
  " Use :an rather than :menu to apply to all modes.

  " Clear the buffer list
  " --------------------------------
  " <Alt-f>e ==> Close all files. This isn't
  " like <Alt-f>x, which quits and preserves your
  " workspace for the next time you run gVim.
  " This command literally deletes all your
  " buffers and starts a new one for you.
  " TODO This is broken if you <Alt-f>c some
  "      files and then quit -- the closed
  "      buffers are reopened. I think this is
  "      probably got to do with what's in
  "      Session.vim -- but even if I <Alt-f>c
  "      one buffer, then modify another buffer,
  "      save it, and quit- on restart, the
  "      buffer I closed is reopened (meaning,
  "      Session.vim was rewrit but still
  "      contains the closed buffers). This also
  "      has to do w/ Vim hidden buffers, which I
  "      don't completely get yet -- if you close
  "      a buffer and remove it from your buffer
  "      list, why is it just hidden and not
  "      really gone? Does this have to do with
  "      tags that are set, or something?
  " NOTE To work-around this, you have to <Alt-
  "      f>e to close all buffers, and then you
  "      have to <Alt-f>x to quit -- I've got it
  "      so if there's only the one empty buffer
  "      open when you quit, then Session.vim is
  "      deleted. Then, when you re-run Vim, none
  "      of those closed buffers are re-opened.

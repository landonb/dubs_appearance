" In any case, the command is something like the following.
" The :match command changes the color of characters that
" match the specified pattern
"   :match ErrorMsg '\%>80v.\+'
" You can turn off this feature using
"   :match none
" Lastly, I'm not sure what this command does, though I think
" I was using it to test. It might split longs lines, I dunno...

" gVim Right-Click Menu
" ---------------------

" 2018-12-09: Learn something new everyday:
" Dubs Vim will (should) by default give a right-click popup context menu,
" via `set mousemodel=popup`. However, if you start without plugins, e.g.,
" `gvim --noplugin`, right-clicking extends a selection (=extend) instead.
" For more, :help popup-menu.

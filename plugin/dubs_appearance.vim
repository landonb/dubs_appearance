" NOTE Vim's default is to set

"      which means we can't update _this_ file
"      without first deleting ~/.vim/Session.vim
"      or ~/vimfiles/Session.vim -- otherwise,
"      Session.vim overrides any changes we make
"      here (because it stores mappings, etc.,
"      and is loaded after this file).
"      Alternatively, we could set
"      sessionoptions to save only winsize,
"      buffers, etc., but not options: though I
"      haven't tested this, so for now: delete
"      Session.vim if you m*ck w//touch this
"      fi#e.
"
" NOTE I still haven't figured out unloaded/
"      hidden buffers, such that :Bclose all and
"      restarting Vim starts with the buffers
"      you just closed -- as a kludge, we'll

" *** Configure the &guioptions setting.
"
" The default guioptions depend on the platform:
"
"   'aegimrLtT' (GTK)
"   'egmrLtT'   (Windows)
"
" These are the default flag options (* indicates GTK-only):
"
"   * 'a' âAutoselectâ: something about what's selected being automatically
"         added to the clipboard, or maybe I read the help wrong, because
"         I tested with and without this setting, and I could not figure
"         out how it works. So we'll exclude this option, I don't think
"         we're missing anything.
"           To test again: set guioptions+=a
"     'e' âAdd tab pages when indicated with 'showtabline'.â Dubs Vim does
"         not reference 'showtabline', except now in this comment, and it's
"         always had this option enabled, so leaving enabled, though I'm
"         not sure how it operates/what it does.
"           To test without: set guioptions-=e
"     'g' âGrey menu items: Make menu items that are not active grey.â We can
"         leave this enabled, in case the user wants shows the menu bar again.
"   * 'i' âUse a Vim icon.â I.e., what you see when you Alt-Tab, and what you
"         see in the MATE (or Gnome, whatever) Window List Panel (e.g., the
"         MATE Window List application is /usr/lib/mate-panel/wnck-applet).
"         - 2020-03-01: This has never been enabled in Dubs Vim (not since 2009),
"           but I did not leave myself a note why, which leaves me w/ 2 guesses:
"           (a) I forgot about this setting when I migrated from developing on
"           Windows to Linux sometime last mid-decade (though you'd think my
"           10-year-younger self would have noticed and cared that guioptions
"           is different depending on the platform, and would have written an
"           if-else block to set guioptions accordingly; but also maybe I was
"           more naive back then); or, perhaps
"           (b) I deliberately disabled this option (but did not comment why)
"           because I find the Vim icon ugly and dated. But if that's the case:
"           MAYBE/2020-03-01: Customize the Vim icon (to your liking). (Now that
"           I figured out how to get gvim to set an icon for the window manager,
"           can I easily edit and customize that icon? To personalize it to my
"           taste?)
"     'm' âMenu bar is present.â As mentioned in later comment section, hiding.
"     'r' âRight-hand scrollbar is always present.â. A feature that you'd at
"         first think you want -- because all graphical text editors would use
"         one, right? -- and that Dubs Vim has had enabled since its humble
"         roots in 2009. But now it's 2020, and scrollbars are so dated. Who
"         uses them anymore? Maybe as a visual reference to gauge how big a
"         file is, or maybe to see where the cursor is relative to the top
"         or bottom of a file; but both of those informations can be gleaned
"         (and more precisely, too), from the status footer (aka mescaline)
"         (well, so long as the file path is not so long that it clips those
"         details from the status line). As for scrolling, I either use keys
"         (Ctrl-Up/-Down, Page Up/Down, gg, G, Ctrl-Home, etc.) or the mouse
"         wheel; I cannot recall the last time I grabbed a scrollbar elevator.
"     'L' âLeft-hand scrollbar is present when ... a vertically split window.â
"         For same reasons as right-hand scrollbar, hiding, because I only used
"         the scrollbar as a visual cue to tell the relative line position and
"         file length, but that information is included (and more precisely, too)
"         in the dubs_mescaline status line below each window.
"     't' âInclude tearoff menu items.â A 'cute' feature that lets you float
"         menus and submenus, but also which seems completely useless. I cannot
"         think of a good use case. Maybe if I wanted to repeat the same command
"         over and over again using my mouse, or something? In any case, leaving
"         enabled, because it doesn't get in the way, and it's always been part
"         of the team.
"     'T' âInclude Toolbar.â That row of useless clickable icons wired to a few
"         simple commands. Dubs Vim has hidden the toolbar since Dubs Vim's
"         inception back in 2009, and Dubs Vim plans to continue to shun the
"         Vim Toolbar in perpetuity.
"
" Dubs Vim historically (for the past 10 years, since 2009) has hidden the
" toolbar, but it has not hidden the menu bar, noting: "Get rid of (hide) the
" silly, space-wasting Vim toolbar (but not menu bar)."
" - 2020-03-01: But I've grown since then. And now I want to hide the menu bar:
"   - I'd rather have the additional line space (1 more row in my editor!).
"   - I'd appreciate less clutter in my view, especially when Vim is fullscreen.
"   - I never use the menu for discovery (to see what commands are available),
"     and I never interact with the menu using the mouse; but I do use the
"     alt-key menu combinations, which is not because I'm lazy and did not
"     bother learning the equivalent Vim builtins, but it was because the
"     alt-key menu hooks work in insert mode, and the Vim builtins do not.
"     (E.g., Vim's <Ctrl-w>q command closes a window from normal mode, but
"     <Ctrl-w> has a different meaning in insert mode. So I would always use
"     the menu bar's <Alt-w>c, which works from both modes!)
"   - To keep the same user experience, just without the menu bar,
"     we'll recreate the menu bar key mappings that we want to keep.
"     - We can use Vim's normal `map` mechanism to recreate the mappings,
"       essentially duplicating the `amenu` commands we want to recreate
"       (but using a normal-looking key binding like <M-w>c, rather than
"       the cute title-and-shortcut-in-one syntax like `&Window.&Close`).
"
" If you run Vim with any or all of these options enabled, you can easily
" disable any one of them:
"   :set guioptions-=m  " remove menu bar
"   :set guioptions-=T  " remove toolbar
"   :set guioptions-=r  " remove right-hand scroll bar
"   :set guioptions-=L  " remove left-hand scroll bar
" Or if you run Dubs Vim with any of these options disabled, you can easily
" enable any one/each of them:
"   :set guioptions+=m  " show menu bar
"   :set guioptions+=T  " show toolbar
"   :set guioptions+=r  " show right-hand scroll bar
"   :set guioptions+=L  " show left-hand scroll bar (when vertical split present)
"
" - HINT/2020-03-01: To be extra clear, the menu bar is still configured as
"   it's always been (that code still exists below), but now we're hiding it
"   on startup. If you want to see the menu bar at any time, simply run:

"  EditPlus-inspired File Command Mappings
" ------------------------------------------------------

" 'It doesn't suck,' says BBEdit. Which I
" started using sometime in the 90s. Then
" I graduated college, and some corporation
" sent monies my way to program on Windows.
" So I found EditPlus, which is the most
" baddest-ass Windows GUI editor ever. No
" Intellisence for me, thank you very much!
" Just file and project browsing, and regex
" searching to boot. And lots of nice keyboard
" shortcuts. Some of which we mock herein. Who
" doesn't have <M-f>e seared into their brain?

" Change gVim application menu key mappings
" -----------------------------------------

" Ctrl-W and Ctrl-Q are GUI editor favorites.
" But in gVim on Windows, <C-q> remaps what
" <C-v> was (which is "start Visual mode
" blockwise", so that <C-v> can be used for
" paste), and <C-w> is the start of all Window
" commands (and if you touch that, an angry
" mob of puritan Vimmers will come find you).
" So instead, get used to Alt-F commands, i.e.,
" the File menu.

" The menu is created and populated
"   $VIMRUNTIME/menu.vim
if has("menu") && has("gui_running")
  " --------------------------------
  " A Close is a close is a close
  " --------------------------------
  " ... No, I mean *REALLY* close it. Don't just
  " hide the dang buffer -- pop it from the list.
  " And show the last buffer we were on.
  "
  " menu.vim's File.Close calls :close, which
  " closes the current window (or hides the
  " active buffer if there's only one window left
  " (and by hide I mean :enew is called to start
  " a new buffer)). So it's not actually closing
  " the file, it's closing the window or making a
  " new buffer. I'm not sure why this is mapped
  " to the File menu... so let's change it and
  " make File.Close really close (i.e., release)
  " the current file buffer. Do any or you Vimmer
  " traditionalists have a problem with that? =)
  " (Also -- redundantly -- the :close command
  "  is mapped to Window.Close, aka <Alt-W>c,
  "  or <Ctrl-W>c.)
  " NOTE 10.330 is File.Close, and 10.335 is
  "      File.-SEP1-
  "      i.e., from menu.vim:
  "   an <silent> 10.330 &File.&Close<Tab>:close
  "     \ :if winheight(2) < 0 <Bar>
  "     \   confirm enew <Bar>
  "     \ else <Bar>
  "     \   confirm close <Bar>
  "     \ endif<CR>
  " 'Un'-menu the existing menu item
  aunmenu File.Close
  " Use :an rather than :menu to apply to all modes.
  an 10.330 &File.&Close<Tab>:Bclose :Bclose<CR>

  " Clear the buffer list
  " --------------------------------
  " <Alt-f>e ==> Close all files. This isn't
  " like <Alt-f>x, which quits and preserves your
  " workspace for the next time you run gVim.
  " This command literally deletes all your
  " buffers and starts a new one for you.
  " TODO This is broken if you <Alt-f>c some
  "      files and then quit -- the closed
  "      buffers are reopened. I think this is
  "      probably got to do with what's in
  "      Session.vim -- but even if I <Alt-f>c
  "      one buffer, then modify another buffer,
  "      save it, and quit- on restart, the
  "      buffer I closed is reopened (meaning,
  "      Session.vim was rewrit but still
  "      contains the closed buffers). This also
  "      has to do w/ Vim hidden buffers, which I
  "      don't completely get yet -- if you close
  "      a buffer and remove it from your buffer
  "      list, why is it just hidden and not
  "      really gone? Does this have to do with
  "      tags that are set, or something?
  " NOTE To work-around this, you have to <Alt-
  "      f>e to close all buffers, and then you
  "      have to <Alt-f>x to quit -- I've got it
  "      so if there's only the one empty buffer
  "      open when you quit, then Session.vim is
  "      deleted. Then, when you re-run Vim, none
  "      of those closed buffers are re-opened.

Dubsacks Vim â€” Appearance Plugin
================================

About This Plugin
-----------------

This plugin configures some basic Vim settings and mappings to
the liking of the Dubsacks developer. There are no functions
or features defined in this plugin, rather, it just configures
a number of basic appearance- and mapping-related Vim features.

For instance, I like a white background; Courier New 9 font;
Ctrl-C to work in Command mode; using a green color to highlight
search matches; always showing the status line; etc.

This plugin also enables so-called MS-DOS mode and configures
some menu item shortcuts.

Please see the source for all the settings and more comments.
